    "- As the name suggests ANN is a network of interconnected perceptrons(represented by colourful circles)\n",
    "- Perceptrons are nodes where decisions are made (they draw parallels with neurons in the brain)\n",
    "- These decisions are made by feeding the input to a function at the node\n",
    "- A function can be linear(like Rectified Linear Unit - ReLU) or non-linear(like sigmoid)\n",
    "- On a lighter note, these function's name and their understandability are inversely proportional\n",
    "- The connection between two nodes draw parallels with synapses in the brain (they carry information between nodes)\n",
    "- In ANN, these synapses carry weights (information of degree of importance) of the input that is going to be feed to a node\n",
    "- A basic ANN has layers of nodes stacked in parallel (The number of layers depend on the complexity of the problem)\n",
    "- The input layer makes no decision, it just provides the input to the network\n",
    "- An ANN can have zero or n number of hidden layers, as said before - depending on the complexity of the problem\n",
    "- The final decison is made by output layer, which gives out the network's decision\n",
    "- An ANN has two primary responsibilities, first making a decision (by a process called Feed-Forward) and learn from those decisions (by a process called Back-Propagation) to make better decisions\n"
